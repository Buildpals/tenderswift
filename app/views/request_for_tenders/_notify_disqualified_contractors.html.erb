            <p>Dear Sirs/Madam.</p>
            <br/>
             We have now evaluated all of the final bids we received.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            On the basis of this evaluation, I am writing to advise you that unfortunately on this occasion you have not been successful.
            The contract was awarded to <span class="winner-name"></span>.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If you would like to receive feedback on your submission we would be more than happy to provide you with this.
            In the meantime, on behalf our organization, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the time and effort you have taken over the preparation and submission of your proposals.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I hope this will not discourage you from bidding again in the future.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Yours faithfully.
            <br/>
